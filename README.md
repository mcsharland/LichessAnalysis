# Lichess Analysis
A chrome extension to import chess.com games to lichess analysis board. Overrides the review buttons because they didn't serve a purpose to me as a free user. 

# Set Up
1. Clone the repo or download a zip.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` or your favorite browsers equivalent. Enable developer mode, click load unpacked and select the folder. Voila

# Usage
Literally just click the review button and it will take you a lichess analysis board. Thats about it.
It should also work with games in the events tab if you click the button in the extensions popup, though this hasn't been tested thoroughly.
Sadly this extension will not work with games from non-standard starting positions, such as chess 960 or record alternate lines played on the board.


# Extras
Developed in the arc browser<br />

I'll tidy up this readme and the code at some point in the future but I haven't had any issue with it yet.
