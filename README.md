# Lichess Analysis
chrome extension to import chess.com games to lichess analysis board. Overrides the review buttons because they didn't serve a purpose to me as a free user. i also didn't want to design a button if I didn't have to.

# Set Up
1. Clone the repo or download a zip
3. Go to `chrome://extensions` or your favorite browsers equivalent. Enable developer mode, click load unpacked and select. Voila

# Usage
Literally just click the review button and it will take you a lichess analysis board. Thats about it.
It should also work with games in the events tab if you click the button in the extensions popup, though this hasn't been tested thoroughly.


# Extras
Only been tested in the arc browser

I'll tidy up this readme and the code at some point in the future but it seems to work for the most part
