# Lichess Analysis

A chrome extension to import chess.com games to lichess analysis board. Overrides the review buttons because they didn't serve a purpose to me as a free user.

# Set Up

1. Clone the repo or download a zip.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` or your favorite browsers equivalent. Enable developer mode, click load unpacked and select the folder. Voila

# Usage

Literally just click the review button and it will take you a lichess analysis board. Thats about it.
~~Also will work with games in the events tab if you click the button in the extensions popup.~~ *This is not currently working as there are no interesting events going on at the moment and I can't be bothered with maintaining it.*
Sadly this extension will not work with games from non-standard starting positions, such as chess 960 or record alternate lines played on the board.

# Extras

This extension will break as chess.com changes their page layout, and I will update it sporadically as I feel like it.
